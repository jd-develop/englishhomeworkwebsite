            Who are we ?
        </h1>

        <p>We are a Kenya-passionned team who thinks that preserving this country is very important for nature and for future generations.</p>
        <P>The Kenya is a beautiful country where there is a huge and important biodiversity.</P>
        <p>In 2016, we decided to create an association to make some actions. You can help us by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">donating</a>!</p>

        <h2>
            Beach preserving and cleaning
        </h2>

        <p>Kenya has a lot of beautiful beaches. But because of ocean pollution and tourism, some beaches are covered by plastics.</p>
        <p>To avoid this, we inform the tourists about the danger of pollution on the ocean wildlife. We put signs on the beach that requests to respect nature.</p>
        <p>But, frequently, this is not enough. In this case, we clean the beaches by removing these plastics with volunteers.</p>
        <p>All the plastics are sent to an association that recycle them into pieces of art. It's beautiful, creative and creates jobs!</p>

        <h2>
            Protecting savana wildlife
        </h2>

        <p>In the Kenya savana, there is a lot of emblematic animals like lions, giraffes, elephants...</p>
        <p>But these animals are in danger of extinction because of global warming and poachers.</p>
        <p>Our association, with the help of the Maasai tribes, helps the Kenyan government to track the poachers and to catch them.</p>
        <p>We also informate people about the fact that these species are in danger of extinction, and that they should protect them.</p>
